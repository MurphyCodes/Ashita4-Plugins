##DatSeeker

A Plug-in for Ashita V4 that displays model ID and Rom path info when you change equipment in game.

###Please Note.
Fishing rods will show up as Unkown in the Type column, this is because the game loads a Hand_model when you equipt a Fishing rod and only loads the Rod model when you start the Fishing animation. atm I haven't worked all this part out yet.

If any .dats other than fishing rods show up as unknown type please let me know the item ID so I can look into it.
