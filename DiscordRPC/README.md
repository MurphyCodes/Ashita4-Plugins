# Discord Rich Presence for Final Fantasy XI

This is a plug-in for Ashita v4.

This will display:
* Server Name - Current location
* Player Name 
* Main Job and level
* Sub Job and level
* Current party count

## How to use
Load Final Fantasy XI via Ashita v4.
* To load the plug-in   - when in game type /load discordrpc
* To unload the plug-in - when in game type /unload discord rpc

## Please note
In the release folder you will find two builds, one for Ashita inertface version 4.14 and one for 4.15.
This is because the version of Ashita HorizonXI are using is still one version behind the current release of Ashita
once they catch up I will be removing old versions.
